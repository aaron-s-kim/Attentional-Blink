# Attentional Blink
Attentional Blink is a psychometric experiment built with Python 2.7. The attentional blink is
- a neuropsychological phenomenon demonstrating the temporal limitations of cognitive processing of visual stimuli
- when presented with two visual stimuli in quick succession, the accuracy in identification for the second stimulus is significantly reduced when presented within 200-500ms of the first

## Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Experiment
Upon identifying a first stimulus (T1) in a rapid visual stream, the ability to detect a second
stimulus (T2) is impaired for the next few hundred milliseconds. This impairment to detect a T2
is referred to as the ‘attentional blink’. The mechanism underlying the attentional blink is still
unclear and current explanatory accounts have proven to be inadequate so far. Thus, an
alternative account is proposed of probabilistic cognition models based on Bayes’ rule to contend
with existing theoretical accounts. This experiment is designed to explore the attentional blink
within the framework of probabilistic cognition by examining if probabilistic manipulations can
influence the magnitude of the attentional blink. This was implemented by manipulating the
probability at which position T2 appeared in the visual stream.
